    "text": "Tips\n\nBe team player - Play well with other rotating medical students. Do not steal cases, answer questions asked to another student (unless you are directly asked), or show up the residents (e.g. if the chief asks a question to a resident, do not correct the resident if they did not know - this actually happens). Residents notice. Also, be willing to help the staff and nurses. This help may include moving patients, opening doors, or answering the phone. With these, you do not want to take the job of another, so read the room. But if a nurse’s hands are full, and you can help, do so.\nBe kind - Please and thank you go a long away. Treat the patients well.\nTake feedback - You will receive consistent feedback on your rotation, that is the point. Take this feedback in stride. Respond to feedback with “sounds good, thanks” instead of “I know.”\nPositive attitude - You are at the bottom of the totem pole, you will get critiqued by everyone, you will be tired, you will have imposter syndrome, people will know answers you do not, you will be bad at certain tasks. This reality is okay and normal. Still come in everyday to do your best.\nBe humble - In your subI presentation include more ‘we’ instead of ‘I’, thank mentors. When you don’t know, say - “I don’t know.”\nAffable is the most important - Many discuss the three As, the order of importance from most to least is affable, available, and then able. The able will come, don’t worry.\nEnd of rotation talk- Whatever time you are allotted, DO NOT go long. Smart to have a resident take a look at your slides beforehand (can improve content, point out common pitfalls, creates an internal champion).\nThe one rebuttal rule - This one is my favorite. When, for example, you are scrubbed in with a resident and they say ‘scrub out, go home, get some rest,’ you can push back once - ‘it’s okay, I would enjoy staying.’ If they double down and insist you scrub out, then you scrub out. Do not push back again because that would then be annoying. This offer is rarely ever a trap (if it is, I am sorry, that was a cruel trap).\nListen for how you can help - Offering to complete a needed task &gt; asking how can I help. When you ask how can I help, while well intentioned, an already overwhelmed resident has to think what task can you do that is educational but also keeps you out of the way. Rather, listen at sign out, listen to the oncall resident take phone calls. You will hear of labs to follow up on, questions for radiology, an EVD prep you can bird-dog and let the resident know when it’s finished. Find these tasks and either follow-up on them without prompting or ask the resident - ‘you cool if I run to radiology to ask xyz.’"

This burden disproportionately occurs in low- and middle income countries (LMICs), where the incidence of TBI is nearly 3 times the incidence in high-income countries (HICs). In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), an estimated 801 people per 100,000 suffer TBI, with in-hospital mortality rates as high as 47% for severe TBI. In HICs, neurosurgical interventions have been shown to prevent morbidity and mortality in certain patients with TBI. However, in SSA, a region with an estimated 1 neurosurgeon per 9 million people, hospitals must balance limited surgical capacity with expansive clinical need.

Neurosurgical decompression, including craniectomies and craniotomies, can relieve elevated intracranial pressure and prevent disability and death in certain TBI patients. TBI morbidity and mortality in SSA remains high due in part to limited neurosurgical resources and a TBI burden that exceeds capacity. In a comparison study, patients with a severe TBI in LMICs had more than twice the odds of death compared to patients in HICs. TBI surveillance registries from the SSA countries of Tanzania, Malawi, Uganda, and Ethiopia reported mortality rates of 47%, 41%, 26%, and 21%, respectively, for severe TBI.

Approximately one-quarter of the 2502 patients in our study received surgery for TBI; those who did had a lower hazard for poor outcome than those who did not. To varying degrees, we observed a benefit of surgery for all TBI severities. Surgical intervention was associated with the greatest improvement in outcomes for moderate TBI, followed by mild and severe TBI. The fully adjusted models revealed variables significantly associated with both poor and good outcome. This study leveraged advanced statistical methods and a robust data set from an LMIC to investigate the association of surgery with acute TBI outcomes and how that association changes according to TBI severity.\nSecond, third, and forth paragraph\n\nExpand upon the ideas introduced in the last sentence of the first paragraph of the discussion.\nSpecifically, discuss the finding from your paper and how that compares with other similar findings in the literature.\nCite other relevant papers here and “discuss” how your study is similar/different."

    "text": "Limitations\nLogic\n\nExample limitations range from sample size, sample selection, data limitations, response rates, short-comings to method/analysis used, etc.\nAlways have this section and be thoughtful about the limitations. \nThis section shows humility, no study is perfect. \nReviewers will appreciate you highlighting efforts made to partially mitigate limitations.  \n\nExample\nA robust statistical analysis of registry data from a low resource setting needs careful consideration of limitations. First, the decision to operate or not is influenced by factors that may also contribute to the patient outcome. For example, a patient may not receive surgery due to major comorbidities or other negative prognostic indicators. As a result, a patient suitable for surgery may be better positioned to have a good outcome. To mitigate this limitation, we used the data available to control for predictor of outcome (e.g., GCS score, age). Also, previous research in similar contexts of care has found that limited resources may be focused on more severely injured patients. The TBI registry used in this study did not include the GCS score at the time of surgery because this information was not always readily available to the research team. The type of surgery was also not documented in the database; however, the general surgery staff endorsed performing mostly burr holes and some hemicraniectomies/craniotomies. The registry included fewer patients who suffered severe and moderate TBI than those with mild injuries. The smaller sample size limited our ability to draw inferences from the survival analyses at later HDs. Other than the admission GCS score, we did not have data on the injury itself (e.g., CT results) to understand the severity of the TBI. We also did not have information on other injuries that might have caused poor outcomes. Finally, we did not have patient outcomes data past hospitalization due to the limited postdischarge contact and care in this clinical setting. This limited our analysis to in-hospital outcomes only."

This paper provides an analysis of surgical management and outcomes data from a tertiary referral center in Moshi, Tanzania. Surgical intervention improved outcomes for all patients with mild, moderate, and severe TBI. The positive impact of surgery to improve outcomes, however, was greatest for patients with moderate and mild TBI. Future research should investigate which patients with TBI are the best candidates for surgery and what factors contribute to clinical deterioration for patients with longer hospital stays, especially in the low-resource setting."

Can be something in their office, your hobbies, research, hometown, whatever. That common ground leaves a good impression. \n- Less is more. If they are interested they will ask follow up questions. E.g. Do not talk for 2 minutes when they say ‘tell me about yourself.’ \n- Smile, have a confident, healthy cadence to your speech (resist nervous pressured speech), appropriate eye contact - these things convey confidence. \n- Work in unscripted questions when opportunities arise - are you a big reader? What book are you currently reading or what’s one of your favorites?\n- Glean tactfully the PD-chair relationship - this relationship dictates if things will get done if residents have gripes. \n\n- Do not add to the pressure by comparing yourself to others. Everyone has incredible stories and CVs but that doesn’t matter. The fit is most important and that is decided by you alone. If you are a good fit, you will stand out. \n- When asked what specialty you are interested in - dont be too specific and say xyz is what I will do, but don’t be too vague and say it all sounds good. Say I have had exposure to xyz and have enjoyed xyz aspect of it; however, I realize there is much I haven’t seen/experienced so I have an open mind - something like that. \n- Follow up with 1-3 people - residents and faculty by email and text (don’t write letters). This follow-up shows interest, establishes a point of contact come rank list time, makes them feel good about themselves, and gives them an opportunity to hit reply and give feedback. LESS IS MORE with these messages."
