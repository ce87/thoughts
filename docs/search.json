    "text": "Tips\n\nBe team player - Play well with other rotating medical students. Do not steal cases, answer questions asked to another student (unless you are directly asked), or show up the residents (e.g. if the chief asks a question to a resident, do not correct the resident if they did not know - this actually happens). Residents notice. Also, be willing to help the staff and nurses. This help may include moving patients, opening doors, or answering the phone. With these, you do not want to take the job of another, so read the room. But if a nurse’s hands are full, and you can help, do so.\nBe kind - Please and thank you go a long away. Treat the patients well.\nTake feedback - You will receive consistent feedback on your rotation, that is the point. Take this feedback in stride. Respond to feedback with “sounds good, thanks” instead of “I know.”\nPositive attitude - You are at the bottom of the totem pole, you will get critiqued by everyone, you will be tired, you will have imposter syndrome, people will know answers you do not, you will be bad at certain tasks. This reality is okay and normal. Still come in everyday to do your best.\nBe humble - In your subI presentation include more ‘we’ instead of ‘I’, thank mentors. When you don’t know, say - “I don’t know.”\nAffable is the most important - Many discuss the three As, the order of importance from most to least is affable, available, and then able. The able will come, don’t worry.\nEnd of rotation talk- Whatever time you are allotted, DO NOT go long. Smart to have a resident take a look at your slides beforehand (can improve content, point out common pitfalls, creates an internal champion).\nThe one rebuttal rule - This one is my favorite. When, for example, you are scrubbed in with a resident and they say ‘scrub out, go home, get some rest,’ you can push back once - ‘it’s okay, I would enjoy staying.’ If they double down and insist you scrub out, then you scrub out. Do not push back again because that would then be annoying. This offer is rarely ever a trap (if it is, I am sorry, that was a cruel trap).\nListen for how you can help - Offering to complete a needed task &gt; asking how can I help. When you ask how can I help, while well intentioned, an already overwhelmed resident has to think what task can you do that is educational but also keeps you out of the way. Rather, listen at sign out, listen to the oncall resident take phone calls. You will hear of labs to follow up on, questions for radiology, an EVD prep you can bird-dog and let the resident know when it’s finished. Find these tasks and either follow-up on them without prompting or ask the resident - ‘you cool if I run to radiology to ask xyz.’"
