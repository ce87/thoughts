\- In an interview, your personal mission is to establish common ground asap...neurosurgery or non-neurosurgery related. Can be something in their office, your hobbies, research, hometown, whatever. That common ground leaves a good impression. 

\- Less is more. If they are interested they will ask follow up questions. E.g. Do not talk for 2 minutes when they say 'tell me about yourself.' 

\- Smile, have a confident, healthy cadence to your speech (resist nervous pressured speech), appropriate eye contact - these things convey confidence. 

\- Work in unscripted questions when opportunities arise - are you a big reader? What book are you currently reading or what's one of your favorites?

\- Glean tactfully the PD-chair relationship - this relationship dictates if things will get done if residents have gripes. 

\
- Do not add to the pressure by comparing yourself to others. Everyone has incredible stories and CVs but that doesn't matter. The fit is most important and that is decided by you alone. If you are a good fit, you will stand out. 

\- When asked what specialty you are interested in - dont be too specific and say xyz is what I will do, but don't be too vague and say it all sounds good. Say I have had exposure to xyz and have enjoyed xyz aspect of it; however, I realize there is much I haven't seen/experienced so I have an open mind - something like that. 

\- Follow up with 1-3 people - residents and faculty by email and text (don't write letters). This follow-up shows interest, establishes a point of contact come rank list time, makes them feel good about themselves, and gives them an opportunity to hit reply and give feedback. LESS IS MORE with these messages.
